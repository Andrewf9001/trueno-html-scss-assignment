          Keiichi Tsuchiya (土屋圭市, Tsuchiya Keiichi, born January 30, 1956)
          is a Japanese professional race car driver. He is known as the Drift
          King (ドリキン, Dorikin) for his nontraditional use of drifting in
          non-drifting racing events and his role in popularizing drifting as a
          motorsport. In professional racing, he is a two-time 24 Hours of Le
          Mans class winner and the 2001 All Japan GT Championship runner-up. He
          is also known for touge driving. The car he drives, a Toyota AE86
          Sprinter Trueno, has become one of the most popular sports cars; the
          car is also known as "Hachi-Roku" in Japan (hachi-roku meaning "eight
          six"); his car is also called "The Little Hachi that could." A 2-part
          video known as 'The Touge' produced by Pluspy documents Tsuchiya's
          touge driving with his AE86. He was a consultant for the popular manga
          and anime series, Initial D, of which the main character Takumi
          Fujiwara is a character which describes him. He also served as a stunt
          coordinator and stuntman on The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,
          where he also made a cameo appearance.

            Takumi Fujiwara is a student working as a gas station attendant with
            his best friend Itsuki. Itsuki is enthusiastically interested in
            being a street racer. The team he feels closest to and hopes to join
            is the Akina Speed Stars, whose team leader Koichiro Iketani is also
            working at the same pump station. Unbeknownst to his colleagues,
            Takumi helps out his father Bunta as a tofu delivery driver for his
            father's store before sunrise each morning, passively building an
            impressive amount of skill of over 5 years behind the wheel of the
            family car, an aging Toyota Sprinter Trueno (AE86).

            Shortly after the story begins, the Red Suns, a highly experienced
            racing team from Mount Akagi led by Ryosuke Takahashi, challenge the
            local Speed Stars team to a set of races on Mount Akina. Dispirited
            after watching the Red Suns' superior performance during a practice
            run, the Speed Stars expect to lose. Later that night, the Red Suns'
            #2 driver, Keisuke Takahashi, heading home after the last practice
            run, is defeated soundly by a mysterious Sprinter Trueno, despite
            driving a much more powerful Mazda RX-7 (FD3S). An investigation
            into the identity of the driver leads to Bunta Fujiwara, Takumi's
            father. While trying to do his best for the team on Mount Akina,
            Iketani suffers a crash and damages his car and injures himself. He
            is unable to take part in the race to represent his team. Iketani
            begs Bunta to help the Speed Stars defeat the Red Suns, and he
            initially refuses, later relenting to "maybe" show up at the race.
            At the same time, Takumi asks Bunta if he can borrow the car for a
            day to take a trip to the beach with a potential girlfriend (Natsuki
            Mogi), and Bunta seizes the moment by granting permission (plus a
            full tank of fuel) on the condition that Takumi defeats Keisuke.
